## Abstract:

News Reader provides users with the top US news headlines. Users can access a list of all articles, and select an article to access more information regarding the story. Users can read a brief description on the article and access a link to read the full story. It allows users to have a clear and concise archive of the most relevant news so they can briefly read over the headlines, or dive deeper into the biggest stories in the US.

## Context:

This application was created as a take-home challenge during the Mod 4 curriculum at the Turing School of Software and Design, and was meant to simulate a tech challenge in the job search process. It was completed in around 8 hours (1 hour for planning and the rest for coding) and presented as a requirement for graduation from the program.

## Technologies Used:
- React.js
- Router
- Postman
